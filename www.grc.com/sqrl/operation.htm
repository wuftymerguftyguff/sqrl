<div class="red_tight_headline" style="font-size:20pt; margin-top:1em;">SQRL User-Interface &amp; Operation</div>

<p>Developers of SQRL clients are, of course, free to express their understanding of SQRL's operation with whatever user-interface design they choose. GRC's user-interface design, presented below, may be copied directly into other clients and for use on other platforms or used as a starting point. If possible, maintaining a common and similar flow and feature set would likely ease cross-platform use. Note, also, that since SQRL's user-interface strings will be freely available in at least 30 international languages and dialects, designing a close copy of GRC's UI will make immediate translations of the user-interface available.</p>

<p>The design of this page's array of user-interface dialogs consumed more than 60-days of time, because the act of thinking through every possible user-interface consequence of SQRL's initial technology resulted in many significant changes being fed back into the design, significantly improving its operation.</p>

<p>Now, after a total of six months of detailed design work following SQRL's announcement, we have a final stable design against which code can be written. That task is now underway for the creation of GRC's reference SQRL client.</p>

<p>Because the final casting of the design into running code is still likely to result in at least some small changes being fed back into the exact design of the user-interface, the dialogs below should be regarded as a user-interface design schema, rather than as SQRL's final design. We won't have a final design until it is expressed in code. For that reason, although SQRL will be written to support a multi-lingual interface, the translation of its user-interface will await the finalization of the first English-only edition. Once that exists the community at <a href="https://crowdin.net/project/sqrl">crowdin.net</a> (see next section) will receive all of SQRL's final text strings to translate.</p>

<div class="blue_section_heading">Multiple Language Internationalization</div>

GRC's reference implementation of SQRL will be published in more than 30 major world-wide languages and their dialects. The translation is made possible through the &#8220;<a href="https://crowdin.net/project/sqrl">Crowdin</a>&#8221; crowd-sourced translation facility and the participation of many wonderful and willing multi-language volunteers. GRC and the entire growing SQRL community thanks Crowdin for their kindness and generosity in making their service available to GRC, for this purpose, at no charge.

<div class="blue_section_heading">SQRL User Interface Flow</div>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/ui-flow.png" width="305" height="490" alt="ui-flow" /><em>Overwhelming?</em> The detailed presentation below may appear somewhat overwhelming for a typical SQRL user. But keep in mind that the purpose of this page is to display every avenue and option within the SQRL client. For the purpose of design and documentation, it lays out the <b>entire</b> SQRL client user-interface all at once. A SQRL user would typically encounter the initial identity creation dialogs followed by occasional password prompts. Everything else would be presented as the user's experience, needs and usage grows.

<p><em>The user-interface flow chart to the left</em> shows the entire UI-flow for GRC's SQRL client application.</p>

<ul><li>In the typical case, the user would click on a SQRL link or scan a SQRL QR code. That action activates SQRL to respond to the &#8220;sqrl:&#8221; URL or QR code.</li><li>Depending upon the user's own configuration of SQRL for their use, they may (or very likely may not) be re-prompted for either their entire SQRL password or just its hint. The full SQRL password only <b>needs</b> to be provided once when SQRL is first used. Therefore, any re-prompting is only for the user's protection in environments where someone else might use their SQRL client without their knowledge. In environments where that's not possible, all password re-prompting, after the full password has once been provided, can be suppressed.</li>

<li><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/Confirm.png" width="313" height="217" alt="Confirm" />Assuming that all is well and normal, the only thing the user will <em>ALWAYS</em> see, is the single confirmation dialog (shown here to the left) that supplies the website's &#8220;friendly name&#8221; (not some confusing URL) to verify that this is the website the user intends to login to.

<p>This single verification is important because without it a user could be intending to use SQRL to login to &#8220;BlackHats.com&#8221;, but the BlackHats.com site gives the user a SQRL code it just obtained from Amazon.com. Since Amazon.com would always identify itself as &#8220;Amazon&#8221; the user would be expecting to see &#8220;BlackHats&#8221; and not &#8220;Amazon&#8221;. (Note that SQRL's built-in man-in-the-middle (MITM) detection would catch this even before the wrong website's name was displayed, but not every possible SQRL operating configuration can benefit from SQRL's MITM detection and prevention, so SQRL always verifies with the user before login.)</p> 

<p>Note, also, that this pre-login prompting dialog offers an &#8220;Other&#8221; options button which allows the user to perform non-login operations such as completely disabling the site's use of SQRL for security purposes or completely removing all trace of the user's SQRL identity from the site. These are uncommon, but available.</p></li></ul> 

And that's all there is to it! The user will typically click a link on a site's login page, confirm that they're about to authenticate their identity to the site they expect, they click &#8220;<b>YES</b>&#8221; and they're logged in.

<p>Here is the complete, (currently) suggested reference text for each of those four tabs shown above:</p>

<span class="tab">In a Nutshell</span><div class="nice_white_box" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">Before you begin using SQRL to login to websites, your SQRL private identity must be created. You only need one, probably for life, because it reveals NOTHING about you, and it's highly secure. It's just a very long (77-digit) random number.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>From then on, whenever you login with SQRL to a website, your private identity is used to generate another 77-digit number for that one website. Every website you visit sees you as a different number, yet every time you return to the same site, that site's unique number is regenerated.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>This allows you to be uniquely and permanently identified, yet completely anonymous.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>Since you never need to use an eMail address or a password, you never give a website your actual identity to protect. If the website's SQRL identities are ever stolen, not only would the stolen identities only be valid for that one website, but SQRL's cryptography prevents impersonation using stolen identities.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>This is as good as it sounds. It's what we've been waiting for.</div>

<span class="tab">Your SQRL Password</span><div class="nice_white_box" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">SQRL frees you from the burden of logging into Internet websites by doing it for you. But this means if someone else gained control of your SQRL app, they could impersonate you.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>We solve this problem with a SQRL password which YOU use to login to your SQRL. You decide how much login protection you need. You choose your own password of whatever length and complexity you desire. To impede someone guessing, you set how long any password takes to process. And to make longer, more complex passwords less painful to use, the password's first four characters may be used to "refresh" the full password you recently entered.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>You are free to change your password and its various settings at any time. And if you should ever forget or lose your password for any reason, SQRL's Rescue Code can be used to recover your access.</div>

<span class="tab">SQRL's Rescue Code</span><div class="nice_white_box" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">You and SQRL will probably never need rescuing. But SQRL's security is so tight that you MIGHT need a way to unlock things a bit. Here are the two scenarios where you WOULD need rescuing:<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>&bull; If you changed your password and the new one slipped your mind, there's no one to ask. Unlike websites, where you click "I forgot my password", your SQRL app doesn't know it either. If it did, it could be hacked and used to steal your identity. Backups you have made of your identity will have been saved under the password you were using then, so that might help. But your SQRL-assigned Rescue Code will always forgive any memory lapse.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>&bull; Once you have established your SQRL identity with a website, that identity can ONLY be changed with ITS Rescue Code. If someone WERE to somehow steal your SQRL identity (if your phone was stolen and you used a VERY weak or guessable password, or malware infected your device), they could never replace your identity with theirs. But YOU could retake your stolen identity by creating a new one and using the old identity's Rescue Code (which the bad guys would never have) to replace that old identity with your new one.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>SQRL's Rescue Code is a powerful ally. Write it down, keep it safe and never lose it. You will probably never need it, but if you do you'll be very glad you kept it.</div>

<span class="tab">Why Backup?</span><div class="nice_white_box" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;">Your SQRL private identity is a randomly chosen 77-digit number used to generate each of your individual web identities. NO ONE knows what it is. As you use SQRL to identify yourself to the Internet, your identity BECOMES that 77-digit number. If it is ever lost, so is your Internet identity.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>The other reason to backup your private identity is to copy it into another computer or mobile device. Once your one private SQRL identity has been installed into all of your devices, you can use any of them to easily identify yourself on the Internet.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>SQRL provides many simple ways to back up your private identity, and all backups are ALWAYS protected by your SQRL password and Rescue Code.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>Printing backups onto paper, as a small QR code and text (perhaps more than once) is recommended, since paper is the original data storage medium. In many ways it's still the best. Simply store it where you store your life's other important documents. You can also record your backup to thumb drives, burn them to CD's, and store them safely anywhere.<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>But PLEASE do make backups, since NO ONE knows your unique 77-digit private identity... not even you!</div>

<div class="nice_green_box" style="color:#060;"><div style="text-align:center; font-size:larger; margin-bottom:0.25em;"><em>Definition / Glossary Notes</em></div>In the text shown above, and as the UI continues below, terms have been carefully chosen in an attempt to clearly convey their purpose:<ul>

<li><em>Private Identity: </em>The UI text attempts to draw a distinction between the user's single private SQRL identity and the system's multiple per-website &#8220;web identities&#8221;.</li>

<li><em>Web Identity: </em>The term &#8220;web identities&#8221; conveys the idea that SQRL users have unique identities at individual websites.</li>

<li><em>Rescue Code: </em>The term &#8220;Rescue Code&#8221; was chosen to convey the idea that this somewhat daunting code will be needed only to &#8220;rescue&#8221; the user from extraordinary situations. As we'll see below, it's the high-entropy, high-security, system-supplied, 24-decimal-digit code that is used to key the encryption and decryption of what is essentially the user's root identity &#8209; the Identity Unlock Key (IUK). (Please refer to the <a href="key-flow.htm">key-flow</a> page for additional information.)</li>

<div class="nice_red_box"><em>For the technically inclined:</em> This entropy pool is created by initializing and opening a SHA256 hash function.

The &#8220;noisier&#8221; this is the better. Even &#8220;conversion uncertainty&#8221; in the audio and video digitizing analog-to-digital converters will be useful. This continues until many times the SHA256's maximum entropy has been amassed. Once this point is reached the SHA256 function is briefly closed to produce its first 256-bit hash result. This will form the new identity's unencrypted Identity Unlock Key (IUK). The hash function is then reopened, retaining its full state, and additional entropy is added. The SHA256 function is finally closed to produce another 256-bit value from which the identity's Rescue Code will be derived.</div>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/Create5.png" width="508" height="408" alt="Create1" />Since we are really (really) not kidding about the necessity of recording the Rescue Code in some fashion that it can later be re-entered if needed, this next phase of the wizard prompts the user to re-enter the Rescue Code that they presumably have just written down. This serves to verify that, at least at the time of identity creation, they were able to correctly re-enter the Rescue Code. Since the Wizard's &#8220;Next&#8221; button is helpfully disabled until we have a Rescue COde match, one way or the other the user is going to re-enter the Rescue Code if they wish to proceed.</td></tr></table></p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/Create6.png" width="508" height="408" alt="Create1" />One of the reasons people use bad passwords is that no one ever really explained what they should do, and why. At this stage of SQRL identity creation we're about to ask the user to invent another new password. So we try to give this forthcoming request some context, and to briefly grab their attention about the fact that SQRL's SINGLE PASSWORD is fundamentally different from every other password they have ever used. It becomes the master password for their entire online identity. (At least to the extent that SQRL succeeds on the Internet.) We also &#8220;soften the blow&#8221; of asking them to invent a &#8220;long &amp; strong&#8221; password by explaining that most of the time they'll be able to just use the &#8220;password hint&#8221; of the first few characters of the password.</td></tr></table></p>

It allows users to see what they are entering if they choose (which is useful and sane when they have sufficient privacy). It also displays a continuously updated &#8220;Password Security&#8221; rating bar. Using this simple means they'll be able to experiment with any password construction solutions.</td></tr></table></p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/Create8.png" width="508" height="408" alt="Create1" />Next we do two things...<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>We need to verify that the user is able to re-enter their password in a typical password-entry mode. Once they have done that, we are finally able to encrypt and store this new identity in their SQRL client. Therefore, when the password verification field correctly matches their chosen password the &#8220;Set New Password&#8221; button (which was initially disabled and greyed-out) will be enabled. Pressing that button will initiate a five-second &#8220;<a href="scrypt.htm">EnScrypt</a>&#8221; process shown by the progress bar.

So long as the Rescue Code is kept separate (see the next dialog panel) this is safe. So this panel explains that what has now been created can NEVER be re-created (it truly cannot). So we encourage them to back up their new identity right away. They can show it on screen as a QR code for acquisition by a camera-enabled device, save the file to a thumb drive for offline storage, or print it out onto paper (as with QR code and emergency-recovery ASCII code.</td></tr></table></p>

But the saved IMK is encrypted under user's own password, over which we have no real control (even though we <em>have</em> strengthened it as much as is feasible).<span class="font7px"><br /><br /></span>Therefore, to mitigate the danger of a stored identity having a weak, password falling into hostile hands, we pop-up this dialog before any identity export to ask whether the user would like to have their password removed from the identity for storage. It's an additional step, but it should be clear and comforting, and it would hugely help to protect users who insist upon using weak passwords.</td></tr></table></p>

But suppose THEY used your password to CHANGE your password? This is one of the powers of the "Rescue Code": It allows you to recover from a lost, forgotten (or maliciously changed) password.</div></td></tr></table></p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/PassPrompt.png" width="316" height="175" alt="PassPrompt" />Since SQRL authenticates to websites on its user's behalf, SQRL's password system is used to authenticate the user to the SQRL client. This is done to prevent unauthorized use of the SQRL client to log into websites or perform any sensitive SQRL operations (such as displaying the user's private SQRL identity for export. (Actually, SQRL's security management is such that the SQRL client doesn't even <em>have</em> the user's private SQRL identity for export unless the user enters the key.)
<ul>
<li>The dialog prominently displays the user's identity name. Although typical SQRL clients will only be loaded with a single user's identity, multiple identities per SQRL client will be supported and can be used when needed. For example, family members might wish to cross-load their IDs into each other's devices for convenience. Or a shared family PC might be loaded with the entire family's identities. The need for continual password re-authentication makes that safe.</li>

<li>When a SQRL app is loaded with more than one identity, the &#8220;Select Identity&#8221; link will appear, allowing its user to change the currently selected identity shown in the password dialog's title. And an option in the application's settings will also instruct SQRL to always ask which identity should be used before displaying the password dialog.</li>

<li>Since user passwords deliberately require several seconds of process, the password entry field doubles as a progress bar once the user hits &#8220;Enter&#8221; or clicks &#8220;OK&#8221;. This helps to pass the time while the entered password is being processed so that the user knows that something (useful) is going on. As mentioned above, the user can set this processing time themselves, with the understanding that shorter time means that guessing is easier (both for non-malicious friends and definitely malicious bad guys). They should also keep in mind that their full password <b>only</b> needs to be entered after a long period of inactivity or whenever SQRL is first used<b>. . .</b></li>
</ul></td></tr></table></p>

<p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><img align="left" style="margin-right:1.5em;" src="ui/HintPrompt.png" width="316" height="175" alt="HintPrompt" />To encourage users to adopt a strong, attack-resistant (and time-consuming to enter) SQRL password, we &#8220;soften the blow&#8221; by allowing <em><i>just the first four characters</i></em> of the user's password to be re-entered during the same session when SQRL has already been initially provided with the user's full password. We call this a password &#8220;hint&#8221;.<ul>
<li>By default, events which terminate the current session, such as locking the device, logging out of the operating system, or engaging a screen saver, will cause SQRL to immediately overwrite and erase its RAM-resident user password, thus ending the user's session.</li>
<li>When the user's session is still active, but SQRL needs to re-verify that the user is still in control of the device (which it will do frequently to assure the user's security), it will prompt for a &#8220;hint&#8221; of the user's full password &#8209; <em>only</em> the first four characters.</li>
<li>SQRL adopts a zero-tolerance policy for hint mistakes: If the four characters entered do not perfectly match the first four characters of the user's password, the session will be immediately terminated with the in-RAM password overwritten and erased<b>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</b> after which the user will be re-prompted for their full password.</li>
<li>In normal use, this allows the user to quickly and effortlessly re-assert their identity to SQRL, while anyone else attempting to use SQRL immediately afterwards would almost certainly lock themselves out, and also give away the fact that an erroneous password hint had been attempted.</li>
